## [0.1.0a2] - 2024-09-23

- Changed error handling during `Bundle` instantiation. Now message errors will be ignored by default, overrideable
  by a new `strict` parameter. In this mode, a `ParserError` will be raised instead of a `ValueError` as before.
- Renamed the `namespace` argument to `language`.
- Fluent message variables are now no longer passed to `get_translation` using `**kwargs`; instead a `variables`
  parameter is used.

## [0.1.0a1] - 2024-09-13

- Added initial implementation.
